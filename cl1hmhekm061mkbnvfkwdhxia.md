## Microservices Design Patterns

One of the goals of microservices is to speed up software release by decomposing applications into separate autonomous services that can be developed and deployed independently. Other goals include making the application more resilient and scalable. But like any other architecture, microservice architecture brings its own problems. Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems. In this case, microservices design patterns help to mitigate this problems.
